In this repo, I have the same Reinforment agent exploreing different envirements. Each enviremnt has a its name in the filename and each envirement comes with 2 or 3 files:
- The class file that contains the class for the Reinforment agent
- The file that contains code to run the agent in the enviremnt when learning
- and the last file is an optional file that will run the trained agent as is without learning.
